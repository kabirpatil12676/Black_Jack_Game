🃏 Blackjack Game (Python)

A simple Blackjack game simulation in Python where you play against the computer. The game follows standard Blackjack rules and uses a text-based interface. It’s a great beginner-friendly project to practice functions, loops, conditionals, and game logic.

🚀 Features

Deal random cards from a deck

Ace (11) automatically adjusts to 1 if you go over 21

Detects Blackjack (21 with 2 cards) instantly

Computer (dealer) keeps drawing until score ≥ 17

Win/Lose/Draw outcomes with emojis for fun feedback

Play multiple rounds until you decide to quit

🛠️ How It Works

Both player and computer are dealt 2 cards

Player can choose to hit (y) or stand (n)

If the player goes over 21, they lose immediately

Computer draws cards until reaching at least 17

Scores are compared to determine the winner

📦 Example Gameplay

Your cards: [10, 7], current score: 17
Computer's first card: 8
Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: n

Your final hand: [10, 7], final score: 17
